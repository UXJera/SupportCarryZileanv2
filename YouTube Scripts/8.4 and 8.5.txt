Talk about 3 things:

Changes to items

  > Utility --> Still the best at platinum and beyond where teammates are better

  > Damage --> Build costs more

Changes to objectives

  > Games are decided around baron and elders, so games are shorter
  > Short games, less of a chance for Zilean to shine
