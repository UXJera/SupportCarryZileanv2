3Q 3E

Laning Advantages

1) 3Q Gives you enough damage to be a threat in lane

  Damage Chart - 0AP  |  10AP   |  20AP  | 30AP
    Q Rank 1
    Q Rank 2
    Q Rank 3
        *Assuming 24MR (base MR for most ADCS / Mages)

2) 3Q 3E has a lower mana cost and higher accuracy

  Every point into Q raises its cost by 5, and Zilean already has a constrained mana pool.
  You should be poking with Single Bombs and trading with your EQWQ Combo. A stronger slow makes it harder to dodge the stun combo, which means a longer CC chain and higher damage output

3) 3Q single bomb does NOT clear the caster wave, but leaves it with enough HP to die to a single auto

  This helps you shove lane, while giving your bot lane partner an easier time to CS. Going up to 4 points will kill the caster wave

It sets you up for a well-rounded midgame, even if you are behind

2) 3E gives you extra mobility and strong pick potential

    Around level 9, laning phase is over. The extra mobility helps for warding and moving around the map
    Additionally, you have a 70% slow on a target, which guarantees a double bomb or a flash

4) 3Q 3E gives adaptability

  With this order, you are not committed to either "All Damage" or "Full Utility" and you can change your build depending on how the game is going.

  This means that if you are behind or need extra utility, you can max E first. Or if you are ahead and your team needs damage, you can max Q.
