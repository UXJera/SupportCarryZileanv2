Hey this is Jera from Support Carry Zilean and I'd like to share my thoughts on Patch 8.4, and most notably the Ability Power Item Changes.

Most of the discussion will be on the AP damage build, so lets quickly wrap up the changes to Utility.

Utility Build

Utility is still the most consistent Support Zilean build, even after the AP item changes.

The big difference is that you can start Ancient Coin for higher gold income or Spellthief if you want to poke in lane.

There are a large number of solid items to build, such as Ardent Censer, Redemption, Locket of the Iron Solari, Mikael's Crucible. Be sure to pick your utility items based on what your team needs.

Damage Build

PREFACE: While playing a full damage build, I did not have a good time. The items are very expensive and do not work well if you or your team falls behind. This build performs better in gold and lower elos, but has a hard time in platinum and above.

The first item you should build is Archangel's Staff, which builds out of Tear of the Goddess and Lost Chaper. Archangels now provides 20% cooldown reduction and even more Mana, which is the best of the new AP items.

Its worth noting that Lost Chapter is a phenominal item for Zilean because it gives plenty of mana, cooldown reduction, and some mana regeneration on level. The downside is that it costs 1100 gold, but is a solid item to buy early on.
