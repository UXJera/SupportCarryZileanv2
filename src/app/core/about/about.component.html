    <h3>Who is Support Carry Zilean?</h3>
    <p>I am a Platinum Zilean main with over 500k Mastery Points, and former analyst to compLexity Gaming back in 2014. Since then, I have moved away from the eSports side of League and more towards content creation and website development.</p>
    <p>You can check my OP.GG accounts below.</p>
    <p><a href="#">Bomb Rewind Bomb - NA</a></p>
    <p><a href="#">Bombs or Barrels - NA</a></p>

    <h3>Are you the best Zilean (NA/EU/Insert Region Here)?</h3>
    <p>No, far from it. I have an interesting playstyle that works well for me and I nararrate my decision-making quite well.</p>
    <p>There are other Zilean mains who are higher rank who I get input from about the current state of Zilean.</p>

    <h3>What are my goals?</h3>
    <p>I would like to help new players learn Zilean and create more Zilean mains. Zilean is a highly underated champion with several playstyles, but most people see him as an Ult bot or "The Guy Who Throws 2 Bombs".</p>
    <p>Professional players are starting to pick up Support Zilean and abuse his slows and revive. The increase in popularity means a higher chance of people looking for information, and this website is one of the best resources avaiable at the moment.</p>

    <h3>The old website had more content, what happened to it?</h3>
    <p>For now, the <a href="http://www.offmeta.support">old website is still live</a>, and most of the articles are still relevant to this day.</p>
    <p>When I remade this website, I wanted to use the AngularJS framework, which has been a challenge because I started from 0. My timeline was to have the website completed by the beginning of Season 8, but in order to do that, I had to cut several supplemental pieces to reach the deadline.</p>
    <p>I still plan on adding more to the website, but for now, most people visit the website for the guides and quick information, rather than the articles. So I wanted to get that taken care of ASAP then worry about new features later.</p>

    <h3>What about streaming?</h3>
    <p>You can catch me streaming at <a href="https://twitch.tv/supportcarryzilean">twitch.tv/SupportCarryZilean</a>.</p>
    <p>I do not have a schedule, but I mostly play in the mornings/afternoons on West Coast USA Time ((ADD GMT TIMES)) during weekdays. I enjoy playing Normals more than ranked, and I am happy to invite NA viewers if you want to play.</p>
    <p>Drop on by and say hello!</p>
