    <h4>Rune Page Highlights</h4>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/sorcery/sorcery-keystone-1.png" alt="Summon Aery Keystone Icon"/>
    <h5>Summon Aery</h5>
    <p>Summon Aery is a solid keystone for supports with poke and buffs. The extra damage early in lane does add up, and also the shield triggers when you use Time Warp on allies. This can be used to stop a small amount of damage to an ally or proc certain items like <img class="image-inline-sm" src="./assets/images/items/athenes-unholy-grail.png" alt="Athene's Unholy Grail Icon"/> Athene's Unholy Grail or <img class="image-inline-sm" src="./assets/images/items/ardent-censer.png" alt="Ardent Censer Icon"/> Ardent Censer.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/sorcery/sorcery-slot-1-2.png" alt="Manaflow Band Icon"/>
    <h5>Manaflow Band</h5>
    <p>Manaflow Band is incredible because it gives a free spell and returns a percentage of your empty mana every minute. This is crucial in lane where you don't have mana or mana regen items.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/sorcery/sorcery-slot-2-1.png" alt="Transcendence Icon"/>
    <h5>Transcendence</h5>
    <p>Transcendence is an all-star because it gives a free 10% CDR, and turns extra CDR into AP. This is great because it accelerates the pace toward 40% CDR, and adds value for exceeding the CDR cap of 40%.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/inspiration/inspiration-slot-1-2.png" alt="Biscuit Eater Icon"/>
    <h5>Biscuit Eater</h5>
    <p>Having extra sustain in lane is very important, espcially when facing poke lanes. Remember that these restore a percentage of missiong health and mana, they are also usable while other potions are healing.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/inspiration/inspiration-slot-2-1.png" alt="Magical Footwear Icon"/>
    <h5>Magical Footwear</h5>
    <p>Magical Footwear gives you a 350g value, available at or before the 10 minute mark. Future Market does help you reach breakpoint items quicker, but costs an extra 50 gold everytime you overspend. Some people prefer Future Market, I do not.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/inspiration/inspiration-slot-2-1.png" alt="Cosmic Insight Icon"/>
    <h5>Cosmic Insight</h5>
    <p>Adding an extra 5% CDR to everything is alright, but not as impactful as the early lane sustain from Biscuit Eater or the free gold from Magical Footwear. Only take this if you do not plan on taking Biscuit Eater.</p>
