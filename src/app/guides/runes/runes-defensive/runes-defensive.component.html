    <h4>Rune Page Highlights</h4>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/resolve/resolve-keystone-3.png" alt="Guardian Icon"/>
    <h5>Guardian</h5>
    <p>Guardian is a simple keystone that provides a small shield to both you and your closest ally if you take damage. This also can be triggered when you speed boost an ally at low health. Many opponents underestimate the shield absorption and fail to execute on an all-in.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/resolve/resolve-slot-1-3.png" alt="Font of Life Icon"/>
    <h5>Font of Life</h5>
    <p>Font of Life is the most practical of the three choices, and also provides an outlet for <img class="image-inline-sm" src="./assets/images/items/ardent-censer.png" alt="Ardent Censer Icon"/> Ardent Censer (similar to Stoneborn Pact / Ardent Censer from Season 7).</p>

      <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/resolve/resolve-slot-2-2.png" alt="Mirror Shell Icon"/>
    </div>
    <h5>Iron Skin or Mirror Shell</h5>
    <p>The choice of these runes should be decided by what you are laning against. Facing lots of AD threats? Take extra armor. Facing a poke lane (Karma/Sona)? Take the extra MR. Don't forget you get bonus stats when using a potion.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/sorcery/sorcery-slot-1-2.png" alt="Zombie Ward Icon"/>
    <h5>Manaflow Band</h5>
    <p>Manaflow Band is incredible because it gives a free spell and returns a percentage of your empty mana every minute. This is crucial in lane where you don't have mana or mana regen items.</p>

    <img class="" src="../assets/images/runes/icons/sorcery/sorcery-slot-2-1.png" alt="Ingenious Hunter Icon"/>
    <h5>Transcendence</h5>
    <p>Transcendence is an all-star because it gives a free 10% CDR, and turns extra CDR into AP. This is great because it accelerates the pace toward 40% CDR, and adds value for exceeding the CDR cap of 40%.</p>
