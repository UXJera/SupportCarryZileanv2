<h5>Heightened Learning: Mechanics</h5>
<p>Zilean generates 2 / 3.5 / 5 / 6 / 12 experience (does not count towards level up) every 5 seconds. Time in a Bottle is on cooldown when the game starts.</p>
<p>When the amount stored is enough to level up an allied champion and Zilean has been out of combat for the last 10 seconds, he can right-click the target ally to initiate a 1 second channel (if interrupted, Time in a Bottle goes on a reduced cooldown)</p>
<p>A successful channel levels up the target and grants Zilean the stored amount as experience of his own.</p>
<h5>Early Game Usage</h5>
<p>Save it for the level 2->3 transition</p>
<h5>Who to use the passive on in the mid-game</h5>
<p>Generally, you want to use this on someone who can get another rank in an ultimate (11,16) and also on your jungler to have a stronger smite.</p>
